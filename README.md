# Field Theory CLI

Local scheduled-sync extension: `ft sync` can read `FT_X_CSRF_TOKEN` and
`FT_X_AUTH_TOKEN` from the environment, avoiding cookie values in command arguments
and browser database access from launchd. Both values must be present. Explicit
`--cookies` takes precedence; with neither environment value, browser extraction
continues normally. Store credentials in the user's private secret store, never
in this repository. Expired sessions require renewal after signing into X.

Sync and store bookmarks locally, manage Field Theory Library and command workflows, and make local context available to Claude Code, Codex, or any agent with shell access.

Free and open source. Designed for Mac.

Field Theory CLI also acts as the command-line companion to the Field Theory Mac app: it knows the local `~/.fieldtheory` paths, can open Library pages in the packaged app, installs agent skills, and can download packaged app releases from the release feed.

## Repository Family

Field Theory is split across sibling repositories:

- [`afar1/fieldtheory`](https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory): Field Theory Mac app source.
- [`afar1/fieldtheory-cli`](https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory-cli): this CLI, licensed under MIT.
- [`afar1/fieldtheory-plugin`](https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory-plugin): Field Theory Codex plugin and skills.
- [`afar1/field-releases`](https://github.com/afar1/field-releases): packaged Mac app release artifacts and updater metadata.

Use the app source repo for Mac app issues, this repo for CLI issues, the plugin repo for agent-plugin issues, and the release feed only for installer, download, update-feed, or release-artifact problems.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g fieldtheory
```

Requires Node.js 20+. A Chrome-family browser or Firefox is recommended for session sync; OAuth is available for all platforms.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Sync your bookmarks (needs a supported browser logged into X)
ft sync

# 2. Search them
ft search "distributed systems"

# 3. Explore
ft viz
ft categories
ft stats
```

On first run, `ft sync` extracts your X session from your browser and downloads your bookmarks into `~/.fieldtheory/bookmarks/`.

| `ft install app` | Download and install the latest Field Theory Mac app from `afar1/field-releases` |

`ft library open` targets the packaged Field Theory app by bundle id (`com.fieldtheory.app`) instead of trusting the system-wide `fieldtheory://` handler. That avoids accidentally opening a generic Electron development app when another checkout registered the same URL scheme.

For local Field Theory app development, point the CLI at the dev checkout:

```bash
export FT_APP_DEV_DIR=/Users/you/dev/fieldtheory/mac-app
ft library open notes/example.md
```

Packaged variants can override the bundle id with `FT_APP_BUNDLE_ID`. Advanced development launchers can set `FT_APP_OPEN_COMMAND` to an executable that receives the deep-link URL as its first argument.

### Agent integration

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ft skill install` | Install `/fieldtheory` skill for Claude Code and Codex |
| `ft skill show` | Print skill content to stdout |
| `ft skill uninstall` | Remove installed skill files |

### Utilities

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ft index` | Rebuild search index from JSONL cache (preserves classifications) |
| `ft fetch-media` | Backfill/download X media assets for existing bookmarks (default: all pending bookmarks) |
| `ft fetch-media --skip-profile-images` | Download post media without author profile images |
| `ft status` | Show sync/classification status and data location |
| `ft path` | Print data directory path |

## Agent integration

Install the `/fieldtheory` skill so your agent automatically searches your bookmarks when relevant:

```bash
ft skill install     # Auto-detects Claude Code and Codex
```

Then ask your agent:

> "What have I bookmarked about cancer research in the last three years and how has it progressed?"

> "I bookmarked a number of new open source AI memory tools. Pick the best one and figure out how to incorporate it in this repo."

> "Your goal is to look at AI agent bookmarks and come up with a roadmap plotted in the grid of what I should do next across the Field Theory CLI and Mac app projects."

> "Every day please sync any new X bookmarks using the Field Theory CLI."

Works with Claude Code, Codex, or any agent with shell access.

## Scheduling

Sync with cron:

```bash
# Sync every morning at 7am
0 7 * * * ft sync

# Sync and classify every morning
0 7 * * * ft sync --classify
```

Run Possible every night on macOS with LaunchAgent:

```bash
ft seeds search "agents" --days 90 --limit 8 --frame leverage-specificity --create
ft repos add ~/dev/fieldtheory
ft repos add ~/dev/fieldtheory-cli

ft possible nightly install --time 02:00 --defaults --model opus --effort medium --nodes 5
ft possible nightly show
```

Nightly schedules are stored under `~/.fieldtheory/ideas/nightly/`. Each tick starts a normal background job under `~/.fieldtheory/ideas/jobs/`, using your local logged-in CLI sessions and the current `PATH` captured in the LaunchAgent plist.

`ft` respects standard proxy environment variables for network requests: `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`.

## Data

Data is stored locally under `~/.fieldtheory/`:

```
~/.fieldtheory/bookmarks/
  bookmarks.jsonl         # raw bookmark cache (one per line)
  bookmarks.db            # SQLite FTS5 search index
  bookmarks-meta.json     # sync metadata
  oauth-token.json        # OAuth token (if using API mode, chmod 600)

~/.fieldtheory/library/
  index.md                # markdown knowledge base (ft wiki / ft md)

~/.fieldtheory/commands/
  *.md                    # portable commands used by Field Theory and agents

~/.fieldtheory/ideas/
  seeds/runs/nodes/       # Possible seeds, runs, and node prompt artifacts
  batches/jobs/nightly/   # Multi-repo batches, background jobs, and schedules
```

Override locations with `FT_DATA_DIR`, `FT_LIBRARY_DIR`, and `FT_COMMANDS_DIR`:

```bash
export FT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/custom/dir
export FT_LIBRARY_DIR=/path/to/custom/library
export FT_COMMANDS_DIR=/path/to/custom/commands
```

To remove bookmark and Library data: `rm -rf ~/.fieldtheory/bookmarks ~/.fieldtheory/library`

## Field Theory Repos

The CLI is one piece of the Field Theory repo family.

- [`afar1/fieldtheory`](https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory): Field Theory Mac app source, licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- [`afar1/fieldtheory-cli`](https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory-cli): this CLI, licensed under MIT.
- [`afar1/fieldtheory-plugin`](https://github.com/afar1/fieldtheory-plugin): Field Theory Codex plugin and skills, licensed under MIT.
- [`afar1/field-releases`](https://github.com/afar1/field-releases): packaged Mac app release artifacts and updater metadata only.

File app-source issues in the app source repo. Keep binary installer, updater, and release-feed issues out of this CLI repo unless the bug is caused by `ft install app` or CLI launch behavior.

## Categories

| Category | What it catches |
|----------|----------------|
| **tool** | GitHub repos, CLI tools, npm packages, open-source projects |
| **security** | CVEs, vulnerabilities, exploits, supply chain |
| **technique** | Tutorials, demos, code patterns, "how I built X" |
| **launch** | Product launches, announcements, "just shipped" |
| **research** | ArXiv papers, studies, academic findings |
| **opinion** | Takes, analysis, commentary, threads |
| **commerce** | Products, shopping, physical goods |

Use `ft classify` for LLM-powered classification that catches what regex misses.

## Windows Notes

In PowerShell, use `fieldtheory` or `ft.cmd` instead of `ft` because `ft` is already a built-in alias for `Format-Table`.

If browser session sync cannot find the right profile, pass the browser and profile explicitly:

```powershell
fieldtheory sync --browser chrome --chrome-profile-directory "Default"
fieldtheory sync --browser edge --chrome-profile-directory "Default"
```

For Firefox, if profile detection misses the profile, pass the profile directory explicitly with `--firefox-profile-dir`.

If cookie extraction still fails, close the browser completely and retry. As a last resort, pass cookies manually:

```powershell
fieldtheory sync --cookies <ct0> <auth_token>
```

Treat `ct0` and `auth_token` like passwords. Do not paste them into logs, issues, or chat.

## Platform support

| Feature | macOS | Linux | Windows |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| Session sync (`ft sync`) | Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge, Helium, Comet, Dia, Firefox | Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge, Firefox | Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge, Firefox |
| OAuth API sync (`ft sync --api`) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Search, list, classify, viz, wiki | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Session sync extracts cookies from your browser's local database. Use `ft sync --browser <name>` to pick a browser. On Windows, Firefox requires Node.js 22.5+ or `sqlite3` on PATH. For unsupported browsers or platforms, use `ft auth` + `ft sync --api`.

## Security

**Your data stays local.** No telemetry, no analytics, nothing phoned home. The CLI only makes network requests to X's API during sync.

**Chrome session sync** reads cookies from Chrome's local database, uses them for the sync request, and discards them. Cookies are never stored separately.

**OAuth tokens** are stored with `chmod 600` (owner-only). Treat `~/.fieldtheory/bookmarks/oauth-token.json` like a password.

**The default sync uses X's internal GraphQL API**, the same API that x.com uses in your browser. For the official v2 API, use `ft auth` + `ft sync --api`.

Do not open a public issue for suspected vulnerabilities, exposed credentials, auth bypasses, token-handling bugs, or private data exposure. Use the private maintainer contact in `SECURITY.md`.
